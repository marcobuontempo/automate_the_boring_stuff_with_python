**Other:**
- The 1st Version of "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python" was used; Currently, there is a 2nd Version available with updated projects.
- These programs were once-off demos for learning and reference. They will not be updated to ensure functionality (i.e. web-scraping programs will break if the accessed websites change their structure, or API calls will break if there are changes to these externally provided services)
- Most programs will work (and were designed to work) on either Windows/Linux/OSX. However, since these were created on OSX, there may be some occasional programs where Windows/Linux is not supported correctly, as it is outside the scope and purpose of this repo.
